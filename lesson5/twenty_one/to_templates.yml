to_rules: "The goal of Twenty-One is to try to get as close to 21 as possible,\n\
  without going over. If you go over 21, it's a \"bust\" and you lose.\n\n\
  Card values: The numbers 2 through 10 are worth their face value.\n\
    The jack, queen, and king are each worth 10,\n\
    and the ace can be worth 1 or 11.  If the sum of the hand  exceeds 21\n\
    then one or more of the aces must be worth 1.\n\
    You can play a competition where\n\
    the first player that wins <%= TORunner::GAME_THRESHOLD %> rouds wins the Game.\n"
